# media-form

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the form. The page contains:

- A form with text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a submit button.
- Styled button and responsive layout via `css/style.css`.
- An embedded Instagram reel (embed block included in `index.html`).

To run locally, open the file in a browser or serve with a simple static server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000
```
